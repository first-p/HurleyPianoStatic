            <h1>This Year Autism and Music 2018</h1>
            <h4>by Richard Hurley | Feb 22, 2024 | Music Blog | 0 comments</h4>
            <p>Watching so many of my students develop deeper skills at the keyboard has me thinking about new projects for HurleyPiano. Music and coding go hand in hand so we are currently researching a Kickstarter campaign to promote a coding and music project for the special needs community. Perhaps there is a connection between the pieces played and new code; what is the underlying code behind Riders On the Storm by The Doors or Smoke On the Water by Deep Purple?<br><br>
                I know by now not to predict the outcome as our community of amazing students will do nothing except surprise us all with their ingenuity and creativity. My students have made connections between The Entertainer by Scott Joplin and Fur Elise by Beethoven; between Eine Kleine Nachtmusik by Mozart and Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen. It is impossible to predict what will happen in any lesson.<br><br>
                I want to watch my students turn Vaderâ€™s March into code or sketch out correlations between between jazz and baroque. Riders On the Storm and Prelude in C by CPE Bach is a favorite combination in our studio. Or Prelude in C and Putting On the Ritz by Irving Berlin. Just as Mozart never heard his Requiem performed, The Doors never performed Riders On the Storm before a live audience or in concert. Both Mozart and Jim Morrison died shortly after finishing their respective projects.<br><br>
                Watching the students in their lessons it is easy to see how our kiddos on the spectrum are fascinated by deeper underlying patterns and structure to the surface appearance of things. So now the challenge is to help them see patterns in code and unleash their pattern recognition talents on the emerging world of AI and music.
