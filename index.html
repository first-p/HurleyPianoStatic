            <p>“Richard Hurley is brilliant when it comes to teaching children and young adults 
                on the autism spectrum. What impresses me most about Richard is his calm, even demeanor. He has a real ability in reading the child and where they are in the moment —from moment to moment at times. I highly recommend Richard Hurley and his style of piano teaching to those living with Autism and their family.”</p>
